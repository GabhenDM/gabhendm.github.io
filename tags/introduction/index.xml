I see you found your way to this blog, in here i will try to document part of my journey as a AppSec Engineer (Which will involve many topics in both Software Engineering and Devops fields, as they are deeply tied with my current work and day-to-day responsibilities.)
All of this will be from my own POV, with my opinion on the material/tooling/software/language/project i currently work on, so your mileage may vary.</description></item></channel></rss>
