Hi! My name is Gabriel Henriques and i'm a Junior Application Security Engineer currently working @ Globo

I'm extremely interested in DevOps and DevSecOps topics, with a focus on Cloud Native tooling and security, such as Kubernetes.

My hobbies are cicling, travelling and music. Along with a deep passion for video-games and movies.

I'm also the owner of two small (but extremely active and potentially destructive) cats, named Tesla and Ciri!
